Problem Set 10 

This problem set will test out your ggploting skills using the Big 5 health dataset 
that you wrangled in problem set 9. The repository includes starter code and example
figures for each question. Your graph should use the same geoms, and map the same variables 
to the same aesthetics as these examples. 
Feel free to show your creativity when customizing color, lines, etc!

This is an individual assignment, but as always feel free to consult with classmates.
